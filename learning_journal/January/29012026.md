## 🤖 The First Encounter with AI (Artificial Intelligent)
Since the birth of Chatgp in end of 2022, I was in deep fascination with AI (Artifical Intelligent). I ask myself how a software application can actually response to what you are asking. At that point of time, I was just graduated from a Full Stack Developer bootcamp and landed myself as a entry-level programmer analyst. During those days, as my knowledge in programming wasn't that strong, I tends to use Chatgpt quite often for some coding problems, to my surprise, it did actually helps me solve those coding issues that look alien to me. From there, whenever I have some free time, I would google for information on AI, Chatgpt, trying to find out more. While searching, I accidentally found an article that explain
 how to develop a application that similar to Chatgpt using Python programming language.
