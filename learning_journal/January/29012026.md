## 🤖 The First Encounter with AI (Artificial Intelligent)
Since the birth of ChatGPT at the end of 2022, I have been deeply fascinated with AI (Artificial Intelligence). I kept asking myself: how can a software application actually respond to what you’re asking?

At that time, I had just graduated from a Full Stack Developer bootcamp and started working as an entry-level programmer analyst. My programming knowledge wasn’t very strong back then, so I tended to use ChatGPT quite often for coding problems. To my surprise, it really helped me solve issues that seemed completely alien to me.

From then on, whenever I had some free time, I would search online for information about AI and ChatGPT, trying to learn more. But as my project work grows, slowly I had to let go and fully focus on my own responsilbity work.

Today, I writing as a Junior Data Engineer, who continues to learn through a stuctured bootcamp programme. I learnt about a company, Datality Lab sharing his company profile during our pre-career fair talk. The company is AI-focus company, and is currently hiring AI prompt engineer role. Reading about their work instantly reignited my interest in AI. It made me think: "This is it. This is the path." I feel genuinely compelled to give it a try and apply.

But before I give it a go, I need to understand what an AI Prompt Engineer actually does. To bridge that gap, I've enrolled in a specialized course to learn the necessary technical skills for the AI prompting industry. My goal is to leverage and align this new knowledge with my background as a Junior Data Engineer.
